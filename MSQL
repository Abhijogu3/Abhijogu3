Description: I recently completed a comprehensive project aimed at enhancing pizza sales performance through SQL analysis. The project involved collecting, cleaning, and transforming sales data to uncover actionable insights. Utilizing SQL techniques such as data extraction, joins, aggregations, subqueries, and window functions, I was able to:

1. Determine the most popular pizza types and sizes.
2. Identify peak sales periods and customer preferences.
3. Compute key performance metrics like total sales and average order value.
4. Improve inventory management to prevent stockouts and excess stock.

The insights from this project helped refine sales strategies, improve operational efficiency, enhance customer satisfaction, and boost profitability. This experience honed my SQL skills and my ability to leverage data for strategic business decisions.
